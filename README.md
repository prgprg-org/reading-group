## Upcoming Meetings

### Wednesday, 9 October, 10:00 (FIT)

- **What:** Type-Level Computations for Ruby Libraries
- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03521
- **Where:** Room T9:364b, Thákurova 9, Praha 6 (see a [guide](https://help.fit.cvut.cz/rooms/index.html) and a [map](https://help.fit.cvut.cz/rooms/map.html#t9-3))
- **Comment:** An interesting perspective on what "types" can mean for dynamic programming languages. Read at least sections 2 and 3, which are accessible and provide nice overview. We can then try to read some of the formalism in section 4 or try to look at the evaluation in section 5. You do not need to read sections 4 and 5 in detail, but try to skim them to see what to find there!

### Wednesday, 30 October, 10:00 (MFF)

- TBA

## Paper Archives and Ideas

* In previous years, the group was organised using a [huge Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sz3G_62GRTERmxXcnczZqGLB1vT_W5dAUewKAMwpKT0/edit?usp=sharing) (remarkably, nobody accidentally deleted it). Check it out for papers we've read in the past.
* Please share your paper ideas (and volunteer to present a paper) [using the Issue #1 in this repository](https://github.com/prgprg-org/reading-group/issues/1).
