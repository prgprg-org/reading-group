# PRG*PRG Reading Group

- **When and where?** Please check back soon. We'll figure this out by the end of September.
- **Email updates** Sign up [here to receive email updates about meetings](https://forms.gle/ZBNJS5QdCa7CvAxV7).

## Paper Archives and Ideas

* In previous years, the group was organised using a [huge Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sz3G_62GRTERmxXcnczZqGLB1vT_W5dAUewKAMwpKT0/edit?usp=sharing) (remarkably, nobody accidentally deleted it). Check it out for papers we've read in the past.

* Please share your paper ideas (and volunteer to present a paper) [using the Issue #1 in this repository](https://github.com/prgprg-org/reading-group/issues/1).
