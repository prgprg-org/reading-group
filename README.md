## Upcoming Meetings

### Wednesday, 9 October, 10:00 (FIT)

- **What:** Type-Level Computations for Ruby Libraries
- **Paper:** https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03521
- **Where:** Room T9:364b, Thákurova 9, Praha 6 (see a [guide](https://help.fit.cvut.cz/rooms/index.html) and a [map](https://help.fit.cvut.cz/rooms/map.html#t9-3))
- **Comment:** An interesting perspective on what "types" can mean for dynamic programming languages.
  Read at least sections 2 and 3, which are accessible and provide nice overview. We can then try to
  read some of the formalism in section 4 or try to look at the evaluation in section 5. You do not
  need to read sections 4 and 5 in detail, but try to skim them to see what to find there!

### Wednesday, 6 November, 10:00 (MFF)

- **What:** FP<sup>2</sup>: Fully in-Place Functional Programming
- **Paper:** https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~swier004/publications/2023-icfp.pdf
- **Where:** Room TBA, Malostranské nám. 25 (see a [map](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/internal-affairs/buildings-and-campuses/mala-strana) and a [building plan](https://cs.mff.cuni.cz/cs/prakticke-informace/plan-budovy))
- **Comment:** The paper describes a subset of a functional langauge where programs can be executed without
  any memory allocation. Read section 1, which provides a nice overview of the language. We will certainly want
  to understand the calculus and well-formedness rules in section 2.1 and 2.2. It may be also interesting to look
  briefly at some of the algorithms in section 3 and 4. 

### Wednesday 27 November, 10:00 (FIT)
Volunteer to present the next paper  [using Github Issues in this repository](https://github.com/prgprg-org/reading-group/issues)!

## Paper Archives and Ideas

* In previous years, the group was organised using a [huge Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sz3G_62GRTERmxXcnczZqGLB1vT_W5dAUewKAMwpKT0/edit?usp=sharing) (remarkably, nobody accidentally deleted it). Check it out for papers we've read in the past.
* Please share your paper ideas (and volunteer to present a paper) [using Github Issues in this repository](https://github.com/prgprg-org/reading-group/issues).
